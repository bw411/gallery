Simple php and jquery gallery for FTP users

This gallery is intended for clients that want to add the gallery to an existing webpage and update 
the gallery via FTP with no database, CMS, or programming knowledge.

Ensure jQuery library is available. If the site does not have a local copy, add the following code to the 
<head> section of the page containing the gallery.
<script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.1/jquery.min.js"></script>

The index.php is an example of the gallery being added to an existing page. 
Open the file in an editor and add the following code in the content section where the gallery should be displayed.
<?php include "bw_gallery/core/bw_gallery.php"; ?>

**** Upcoming changes ****
I intend to add additional templates for the gallery.
An exaple of the gallery will be available online shortly.
